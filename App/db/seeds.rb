# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
individuals = Individual.create([{ name: 'Martin', age: 17}, { name: 'Gosho', age: 42}, { name: 'Tosho', age: 3}])
# Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
